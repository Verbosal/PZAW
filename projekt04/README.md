WIP!!!

# Simple silly forum
## You can:
-Make a post (markdown and embedded hopefully included) ONCE you have an account!!! (and are logged in ofc),
-See all posts using the POST method (get it?),
-Modify and delete your own posts
-Oh, and you can get an admin and modify other people's posts.

Just set up your desired administrator credentials in admin.json and run ```node index.js``` to start hosting the website @ localhost:8000.
