# Simple silly forum
## You can:
-Make an account and log in,
-Make a post (using the POST method),
-See all posts,
-Modify and delete your own posts
-And you can be an admin and modify other people's posts.

Just set up your desired administrator credentials in admin.json and run ```node index.js``` to start hosting the website @ localhost:8000.
